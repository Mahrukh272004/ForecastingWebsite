Forecasting System
Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive forecasting system that implements and compares different time series models (ARIMA, ANN, Hybrid ARIMA-ANN) across various sectors. Additionally, it includes a user-friendly front-end interface for visualizing data and forecasts.

Data Sources and Preprocessing
Finance Sector: Monthly stock prices from the S&P 500 index.
Energy Sector: Hourly energy consumption data.
Environmental Sector: Daily atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
Preprocessing Steps

Cleaning: Identify and impute or remove missing values.
Normalization/Standardization: Scale the data to a uniform range.
Stationarization: Apply differencing and logarithmic transformations as necessary to achieve stationarity.
Tools and Technologies

Backend: Python with Flask for server-side logic, handling API requests.
Frontend: ReactJS for building a dynamic and responsive user interface, HTML/CSS for layout and styling.
Data Science: Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, TensorFlow/Keras.
Database: SQLite for storing processed data and results, enabling quick retrieval for visualization.
Version Control: Git for code management and version control.
Model Development

ARIMA Configuration and Tuning
Purpose: ARIMA is utilized to model and forecast time series data showing non-stationarity or seasonal patterns.
Process: Identify parameters using statistical tests like the ADF test for stationarity and ACF/PACF plots for parameter estimation.
ANN Design and Training

Purpose: ANN models complex nonlinear relationships in data.
Process: Design networks with varying architectures, implement backpropagation for training.
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)

Purpose: Specifically models and forecasts seasonal time series data.
Process: Determine seasonal parameters using statistical tests and plots.
Exponential Smoothing (ETS)

Purpose: Forecast time series data with trends and seasonalities.
Process: Select appropriate models based on data characteristics and configure using error, trend, and seasonal components.
Prophet

Purpose: Handles time series with strong seasonal effects and historical holidays.
Process: Define the model with seasonal components and holiday effects, adjust flexibility as needed.
Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Purpose: Models nonlinear relationships in data.
Process: Choose kernel and tune parameters using cross-validation.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
Purpose: Suitable for sequence prediction problems.
Process: Design network architecture, select backpropagation algorithm, and tune parameters.
Hybrid Models Integration
Purpose: Combines ARIMA and ANN models to enhance forecast accuracy.
Process: Use ARIMA forecasts as input features to ANN to improve predictions.

Frontend Development

Interface Design
Purpose: Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Process: Design a clean UI with dropdown menus, buttons, and tabs.
Visualization Tools

Purpose: Present data and forecasts effectively.
Process: Implement interactive charts and graphs using Chart.js or D3.js.
Interactive Dashboard

Select different forecasting models.
Display graphs of data, forecasts, residuals, and accuracy metrics.
Compare results between models.
Upload new data and retrain models interactively.
Testing and Validation

Model Testing
Purpose: Ensure reliability and accuracy of forecasting models.
Process: Validate predictions using historical data, prevent overfitting.

System Testing
Purpose: Confirm backend and frontend functionality.
Process: Conduct unit and integration tests.
