# Forecasting App README

## Overview
Welcome to our Forecasting App! This application utilizes two datasets: stock prices data and CO2 concentration data. We have employed various forecasting models to predict future trends based on these datasets. Additionally, we have developed two dashboards on the frontend to visualize the forecasts and enable comparison between different models.

## Datasets
1. **Stocks Data:** Monthly stock prices from the S&P 500 index.
2. **CO2 Concentration Data:** Daily atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

## Forecasting Models
We have employed several forecasting models to predict future trends:
- ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
- ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)
- Hybrid ARIMA-ANN

## Frontend Dashboards
### Dashboard 1
- Visualizes forecasts and trends derived from stock prices data.
- Enables comparison between different forecasting models.

### Dashboard 2
- Displays forecasts and trends based on CO2 concentration data.
- Allows users to compare the performance of various forecasting models.

## Usage
1. Access the application through the provided URL.
2. Navigate to the desired dashboard.
3. Select the dataset and forecasting model you want to visualize.
4. Explore the forecasts and trends presented on the dashboard.
5. Utilize the comparison feature to assess the performance of different models.

## Notes
- Ensure a stable internet connection for optimal performance.
- For any issues or feedback, please contact our support team.

Thank you for using our Forecasting App! We hope you find it insightful and valuable for your forecasting needs.
